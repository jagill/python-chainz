class Chain:
    """
    A Chain is a lightweight, functional, chaining wrapper around an iterable.

    It provides methods such as `map` or `filter` that act lazily on the
    iterable.  Each of these methods returns the chain object so that the
    methods can be chained (hence the name).  It is similar in functionality
    to itertoolz, but in an order the author finds easier to read, and without
    the ambiguity of whether the iterable, or the other arguments, comes first.

    It also includes "sink" methods, which consume the iterable.  For example,
    `reduce` will reduce the iterable via a supplied binary function, and
    `for_each` will apply a supplied function to each element.

    It bears repeating that all operations are performed lazily.  In fact, if
    no sink method is called, and if the chain is not consumed in some other
    fashion (like you would any other iterable), nothing will actually happen.
    The chain will be un-evaluated, and the iterable will not be consumed.
